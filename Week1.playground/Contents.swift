//: ### Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals
//: Implicitly unwrapped optionals are useful when an optional‚Äôs value is confirmed to exist immediately after the optional is first defined and can definitely be assumed to exist at every point thereafter. The primary use of implicitly unwrapped optionals in Swift is during class initialization

let possibleString: String? = "An optional string."

//:  Implicitly unwrapped optionals should not be used when there is a possibility of a variable becoming nil at a later point. Always use a normal optional type if you need to check for a nil value during the lifetime of a variable.

//: ## Error Handling
//: In contrast to optionals, which can use the presence or absence of a value to signify success or failure of a function, error handling allows you to determine the underlying cause of failure and if necessary propagate the error to another part of your program.

    // This function may or may not throw an error.

//: ## Assertions
